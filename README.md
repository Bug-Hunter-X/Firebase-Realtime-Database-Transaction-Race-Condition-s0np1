# Firebase Realtime Database Transaction Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a race condition that can occur when using Firebase Realtime Database transactions.  Concurrent updates can lead to incorrect data due to the asynchronous nature of the operation.  The provided code shows the problem and a solution to mitigate it.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains code that increments a value in the database using a transaction.  If multiple clients execute this code concurrently, there's a chance that the final value will be incorrect because each transaction operates independently and doesn't see updates made by other concurrent transactions.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates a more robust approach that utilizes server-side timestamps to create a unique identifier for each update attempt. This avoids the race conditions by ensuring each increment happens in a separate, unique context, guaranteeing a correct final value.
