The following code snippet demonstrates a common error when working with Firebase Realtime Database transactions:

```javascript
firebase.database().ref('path/to/data').transaction(function(currentData) {
  if (currentData === null) {
    return {
      value: 1,
    };
  } else {
    return {
      value: currentData.value + 1,
    };
  }
});
```

The issue lies in the potential for race conditions. If multiple clients attempt to increment the value concurrently, the transaction might not correctly reflect the cumulative changes. This is because transactions are atomic operations only within their scope. If two transactions attempt to read and update at almost the same time, one might overwrite the changes from the other.
