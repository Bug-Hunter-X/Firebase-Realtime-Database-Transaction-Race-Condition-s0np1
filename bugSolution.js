To mitigate the race condition, use a server-timestamp to ensure that each transaction has a unique context:

```javascript
firebase.database().ref('path/to/data').transaction(function(currentData) {
  const newKey = firebase.database().ref().push().key;
  const newTransactionData = {
    value: (currentData ? currentData.value : 0) + 1, 
    transactionId: newKey
  };
  return newTransactionData;
});
```

By adding a unique key for each transaction (server-side timestamp for uniqueness), the database can handle concurrent updates without data loss or inconsistencies.  The solution prevents the overwriting of updates.  Each transaction can then be tracked independently and processed reliably.
